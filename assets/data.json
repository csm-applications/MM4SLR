For the first type of SLR, the investigators define the research questions precisely to reflect exactly what they want to know. The traditional SLR process is designed to guide the review process to be tightly centered on those defined research questions. In this situation, our experience is that following the traditional SLR rather than using the general 5W+1H model can be more effective. For the second type of SLR, investigators may have less prior knowledge on the topic and, hence, find it challenging initially to propose effective research questions to capture what they want to know about this topic. Then it is better to apply the 5W+1H model as a good starting point to define the research questions first. One may later gradually add more topic-specific contexts to refine the research questions to guide the review process. To this end, the 5W+1H model provides an exploratory framework to shape a SLR.",

Other analysis tools (such as visual display tools) can then be used to identify whether articles that are similar with respect to the frequency of those words or phrases are treated similarly in the SR. This approach can be used:\n\n1. To refine automated search strings, P29. \n2. To identify similar papers as part of the paper selection process, P11, P26, P28, P46, P50, P57. These studies offer a different approach to those discussed in Section 5.3.2. They use the tools to investigate whether included and excluded studies are similar with respect to studies’ most important keywords and rely on SR researchers to interpret the information provided. The studies discussed in Section 5.3.2 provide a quantitative assessment of the search process effectiveness (although the SR researchers still need to decide whether the achieved effectiveness is sufficient). \n3. To categorize and classify articles for a mapping study, P27. \n4. To select articles that address a specific research question, P50, P56. \n5. To extract the data needed to answer specific research questions P56, P68\"",

Second, in some cases, quality assessment was thought to be unnecessary because the primary studies were retrieved from ‘‘trustworthy sources’’ (e.g., peer-reviewed journals), and this was considered to be sufficient to guarantee the quality of the primary studies (e.g., [SE43]). Third, in other cases, the search process found so few relevant studies that the researchers may have feared that applying quality criteria would leave them with no studies to analyse (e.g., [SE39]).
