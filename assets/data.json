First, some researchers appear to have confused quality assessment with explicitly stating the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the primary studies and may therefore have thought that no further quality assessment was necessary (e.g., [SE42]). Second, in some cases, quality assessment was thought to be unnecessary because the primary studies were retrieved from ‘‘trustworthy sources’’ (e.g., peer-reviewed journals), and this was considered to be sufficient to guarantee the quality of the primary studies (e.g., [SE43]). Third, in other cases, the search process found so few relevant studies that the researchers may have feared that applying quality criteria would leave them with no studies to analyse (e.g., [SE39]).
